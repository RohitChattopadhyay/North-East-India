<div class="myGap"><span class="indent">Assam is a state in northeastern India. Located south of the eastern Himalayas, Assam comprises the Brahmaputra Valley and the Barak Valley along with the Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao districts with an area of 30,285 mi<sup>2</sup> (78,440 km<sup>2</sup>). Assam, along with Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura and Meghalaya, is one of the Seven Sister States. Geographically Assam and these states are connected to the rest of India via a 22 kilometres (14 mi) strip of land in West Bengal called the Siliguri Corridor or "Chicken's Neck".Assam shares an international border with Bhutan and Bangladesh; and its culture, people and climate are similar to those of South-East Asia -comprising the elements in India's Look East policy. Assam became a part of British India after the British East India Company occupied the region following the First Anglo-Burmese War of 1824 -1826.</div>

<div class="myGap"><span class="indent">Assam is known for Assam tea and Assam silk. The first oil well in Asia was drilled here. The state has conserved the one-horned Indian rhinoceros from near extinction, along with the wild water buffalo, pygmy hog, tiger and various species of Asiatic birds. It provides one of the last wild habitats for the Asian elephant. The Assamese economy is aided by wildlife tourism, centred around Kaziranga National Park and Manas National Park which are World Heritage Sites. Sal tree forests are found in the state, which as a result of rainfall looks green all year round. Assam receive more rainfall compared to most part of India. This rain feeds the Brahmaputra River, whose tributaries and oxbow lakes provide the region with a hydro-geomorphic and aesthetic environment.</div>
